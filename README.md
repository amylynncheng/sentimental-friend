# sentimental-friend
A Google Assistant app/conversational chat bot capabale of responding to a wide range of user emotions.

App description: 
Sentimental friend will always be there to ask you how your day went or how you're feeling. Based on how you're feeling, she can offer services catered to making you feel better or keep feeling great. For example, good friend can crack as many jokes as you want when you're feeling down, listen to how you're feeling if you've had a really bad day, help you relax if you're stressed, or offer things to do when you're feeling good and ready to take on the world! 

If you ever need someone to talk to, good friend will lend a listening ear and a few words of advice that will hopefully make your life a bit less hectic.

Basic Instructions:
* Answer the opening question of "How are you feeling?" with a single emotion. Currently accepted emotions are of the following types: happy, sad, bored, depressed/scared, stressed, tired, neutral, excited, homesick, lonely, hungry, and sick.
* Say "help" for a list of possible options. Functions listed can usually be invoked by saying the phrase listed in "help".
* Examples of invoking functions: 
  * "Tell me a joke"
  * "Help me relax"
  * "Play a guessing game" 
  
* Functions that can *only* be invoked from emotions: 
  * Depression screening / therapy (depressed)
  * 4-7-8 breathing exercise (tired)
  * Robot revolution game (bored)
